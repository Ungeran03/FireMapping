function updatedState = updateEstState(state, spreadRate)
%This function updates an estimated state map with new belief about the
%   fire spread based on the current estimated state map.
%
%Inputs:
%   state = the current estimated state map
%   spreadRate = the rate of fire propogation
%
%Outputs:
%   updatedState = a copy of state that has been updated to reflect one step
%       of fire propogation
