function reward = getReward(uncertainty, agent, currentVertex, repulsiveForceCoeff, numAgents, mapSize, uavRows, uavCols, distanceMap, alpha)
%This function computes the reward for a location in the state space.
%
%Inputs:
%   uncertainty = The uncertainty at a single location in the state space.
%   agent = The agent for which the reward is being calculated.
%   currentVertex = The location in the state space for which the reward 
%       is being calculated.
%   repulsiveForceCoeff = The repulsive force factor between agents.
%   numAgents = The number of agents in the state space.
%   mapSize = The length of one side of the square state space.
%   uavRows = The current row location of all UAVs in the state space.
%   uavCols =  The current column location of all UAVs in the state space.
%   distanceMap =  A mapSize^2 x mapSize^2 matrix with the distances
%       between all locations in grid square units (not meters).
%   alpha = The alpha weighting parameter for the reward function.
%
%Outputs:
%   reward = The reward of the location in the state space.
