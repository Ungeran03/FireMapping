function outState = spreadFire(inState, spreadRate)
%This function controls how the fire is spread in the simulation.  This
%   version finds all locations that are on fire and percolates the fire to
%   adjacent positions based on the spread rate.  The spread is binary, it
%   either spreads or it does not spread.
%
%Inputs: 
%   inState = The current true state of the state space.
%   spreadRate = The rate of fire percolation.
%   
%Outputs:
%   outState = The true state after the fire has been spread over one time
%       step.
